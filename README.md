# Futureproof
Desktop budgeting application that instills existential dread into every living moment it is open.

## To-Dos
1. Statistics System
  - Countdown timer until bankruptcy.
  - Graphing.
  - Balance change rate display and calculation.
2. Events System
  - Array log.
  - Cron invocations.
  - Cron invocations while application isn't running.
3. Saving
  - I thought this was done, but it needs fixing.
